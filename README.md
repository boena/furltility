A simple library to get awesome-looking URLs in Ruby on Rails, without a database table to handle it AND, since ID is included in the URL it will keep history if you ever change your URL :)

Instead of a URL like:
http://www.palooza.se/project/1

The URL will now look like:
http://www.palooza.se/project/1-my-awesome-project
